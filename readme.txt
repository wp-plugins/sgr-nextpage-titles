Make order in your posts. With SGR Nextpage Titles you can have post subpages with their own titles and a navigation index.

== Description ==

SGR Nextpage Titles is a plugin that will make you forget the old `<!--nextpage-->` tag because it allows to add more subpages of a post, giving each subpage a title.
SGR Nextpage will show an index, that will link to every subpage found in the post, if shortcode is present. It will show also an index on every page, in order to easily navigate between subpages.

= Have SEO friendly url for your subpages =
Every subpage will have SEO friendly url based on the title.

Even if you will not save a title for your `[nextpage]` code, SGR Nextpage Titles will use a default title in the form "page-n" where "n" is the number of the page.
